# Salary Calculator 9000

## Description

The Salary Calculator 9000 is an application that can be used to determine exactly how much having to pay your employees is cutting in to your monthly profits. Simply complete the input form by entering the employees information, and the app will display them in a convenient table right on the page. The app will also calculate your total monthly profit deficit, and alert you with an onscreen color change when it exceeds the approximate cost of a vintage Alfa Romeo.

Firing some dead weight? No Problem! Just click the convenient delete button for the employee you're terminating, and their families financial wellbeing will no longer be deducted from your precious, precious profits.

Dissolving the company and liquidating your assets? Easy! Just refresh the page, and all your laborious data entry will be for naught!
